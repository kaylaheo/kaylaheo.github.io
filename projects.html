                    <p>In summar 2019, I participated in a program provided by <a href="https://kbig.kr/portal/">K-ICT Big Data Center</a> located at Techno Valley, Pangyo, South Korea.
                    <br><br>Learned how to build big data infrastructure using R library.
                      Practiced text mining through programming a word cloud of expressions and vocabulary used in Shakespeare novel.
                      Utilized KoNLP(Korean Natural language Processing) package to develop flexible data acquisition process that identifies key words from Naver online news.
                      Exposed to ggplot2 visualization through manipulating sample data sets.
                    <br><br>Utilized xrdp which is a graphical login to remote machines; so currently unable to get access to the codes I built</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Since Fall 2019, I joined one of the Cornell Engineering Project Teams called <a href="https://dbf.engineering.cornell.edu/">Design Build Fly</a>  (DBF) to solve complex problems in team-based settings. </p>
                <p> Designed and built lightweight and strong aircraft’s fuselage, landing gear.
                    Accommodated the challenges of the competition’s payload.
                    Evaluated and analyzed aircraft’s performance and stability using MATLAB and ANSYS.

                      <br>Submitted to AIAA, this is a 60 pages long competition report
                      that summarizes the work done by the entire team since Fall 2019.
                      <br><br> As a member of a structure team, I mainly focused on the fuselage, motor mounts, passenger containment, landing gear, and banner mechanism.
