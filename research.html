            <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
            <div class="overview">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                  <p>I studied some of the famous research papers regarding the natural language processing.
                      I developed a deeper interest in the algorithms to quantify simiarility of words and to evaluate of their meanings.
                      I am still curious about how the pre-training is done with a myriad of words, phrases, and sentenses and
                      how it significantly advances the model.</p>

            <div class="overview">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                  <p>I studied mathematical induction, logical proof, propositional and predicate calculus,
                       combinatorics and discrete mathematics, basic probability theory,
                       basic number theory: sets, functions, and relations, graphs, and finite-state machines.
                       Going further, I also explored the applications to many areas of computer science,
                       such as the RSA cryptosystem and web searching.   </p>

                      <p>I practiced basic proof techniques:
                          logical negation, proposition, proof by contradiction, and diagnolization proof.
                          To be specific, I dealt with set definitions, functions, relations, and countability.</p>

                      <p>I went further in studying equivalence relations. I studied several types of inductions:
                          weak induction, strong induction, and structural induction. I also practice famous algorithms in number theory:
                          base b representations, Euclid's GCD algorithm, BÃ©zout coefficients, and modular inverses.</p>

                      <p>I studied automata theory: DFA, NFA, and regular expressions. I am able to convert each of them to another;
                          for instance NFA to regular expression. I applied my learning by praciting pumping lemma and Kleene's theorem.</p>

                      <p>I practiced combinatoric proofs of equations between natural numbers.
                          I also practiced proving probability using Kolmogorov's axioms and Bayes' rules.
                          I also studied Markov's inequality, Chebychev's inequality, and Weak law of large numbers and their proofs.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                  <p>I studied different scientific perspectives to understanding networks and behavior.
                      Drawing on ideas from economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics,
                      I focused on the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of all these areas,
                      addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected.
                      Thus, I practiced building mathematical models of the processes that take place in networks.</p>

                      <p>Topics covered in the note: Graph Theory and Social Networks, Game Theory, and Markets and Strategic Interaction on Networks.
                      I practiced social network analysis, including the famous 'strength of weak ties' hypothesis in sociology.
                      I studied game theory through the context of examples, including the design of auctions and some 'paradoxical' phenomena surrounding network traffic congestion.
                      Also, I studied the interactions among participants in a market and the network structure
                      that provides a natural illustration of how graph theory and game theory can come together in the development of models for network behavior.

                      Institutions and Aggregate Behavior.
                      I practiced modeling the Web as a network; focusing on how search engines make use of link information for ranking,
                      how they use ideas related to power and centrality in social networks, and how they have implemented network-based matching markets
                      for sellling advertising. I studied the exploration of how things flow through networks, how both behaviors and diseases can spread
                      through a social network, and also some of the network phenomena that underpin the "six degrees of separation" effect.
